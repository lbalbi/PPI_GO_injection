This repository contains several datasets that make up graphs that link PPI data to background context. 
These approaches attempt to solve the node classification task for the PPI network benchmark dataset "ogbn-proteins" made avaliable by the OGB project.



This repository contains several datasets that build up graphs constructed over i) a PPI network with the inclusion of meaningful protein annotations to the
Gene Ontology and ii) inclusion of protein annotations to the GO tree.
